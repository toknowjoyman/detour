# Research at Detour

We're exploring everyday commutes and how to make them more joyful, mindful, and connected to life's purpose.

- Primary Research
  - *Are people willing to take the long way home?*
    - In our online surveys investigating the tendency for scenic detours;
      - We saw over 25k viewers and heard from 100’s of drivers in 24hrs on Reddit posts and Linkedin Polls. 
      - Most commenters preferred scenic detours, were willing to spend more time, and additional money, instead of driving on the main thoroughfare. 
      - They appreciated the pleasure of discovering the cultural gems hidden across other streets, and the conversion of mundane trips into memorable experiences.
