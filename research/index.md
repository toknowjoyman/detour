# Research at Detour

We're exploring everyday commutes and how to make them more joyful, mindful, and connected to self.

- Preliminary Research
  - In our online surveys investigating the tendency for scenic detours;
    - we saw over 25k viewers and heard from 100’s of drivers in 24hrs on Reddit posts and Linkedin Polls. 
    - Most commenters and voters preferred scenic detours, and were willing to spend more time, even extra toll money, instead of driving on the main thoroughfare. 
    - They appreciated the pleasure of discovering the cultural gems hidden across other streets, and the conversion of mundane trips into memorable experiences.
